## Limitations & Notes

- **Deadline Constraint:** Due to a tight deadline, not all content sections are fully covered or implemented.
- **Image Sources:** Some images are hotlinked directly from the original site instead of being downloaded and served locally. This was done to save time and meet the submission deadline.
